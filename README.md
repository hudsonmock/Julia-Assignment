Accuracy = 77.9% pretty good accuracy here
Precision = 51.9% not super good, its saying a person would default but its only right about 52% of time. We got slightly better precision testing 70% on training set but overall with 80% training set split it produced most balanced performance.
Recall = 43.8% only caught about 44% of people who defaulted, also not very good but with 80% on training set it catches more defaults than when we tested with 70% on the training set
F1 Score = 47.5% overall grade of precision and recall and its pretty balanced
