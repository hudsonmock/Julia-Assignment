Accuracy = 80% pretty good accuracy here
Precision = 58.3% is saying a person would default but its only right about 58% of time. With 80% training set split it produced most balanced performance.
Recall = 43.8% only caught about 44% of people who defaulted, also not the best, but with 80/20% on training set it catches more defaults than when we tested with 70/30% on the training set
F1 Score = 50% overall grade of precision and recall and its very balanced.
